# Report of the Findings from The Global Food Basket

### I. Introduction
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple visualization of where the world's staple crops are grown. The popular crops I analyzed include: apples, avocados, 
bananas, beans, cashews, cassava, cereals, cocoa, coffee, corn , grapes, oranges, potatoes, rice, soybeans, sugarcane, tomatoes, and wheat. I wanted to explore how 
different regions around the world contributed to the global food supply, and how much has changed in the span of sixty years, between 1961 and 2018. In other words, 
the main questions this report aims to answer are where are the world's major crops produced today, and how does it compare to global agricultural production from 
roughly sixty years ago. This report outlines the findings from the project and visualization created on Tableau.


### II. Data and Methodology

The data I used for my analysis come from Our World in Data datasets. Using excel, I cleaned out a spreadsheet of the agricultural production of each crop, measured in tons, for major regions of each continent for the years 1961 and 2018. Then, I imported this spreadsheet to MySQL for the fun work to begin. I uploaded SQL code repositories for those interested in taking a deeper look at the code that gave me global percentages for each crop and region, and net changes between 1961 and 2018.
