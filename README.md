# Report of the Findings from The Global Food Basket
🍎🥑🍌🌽🍇🥜🥔🍅🍚🍞

### Abstract
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple visualization of where the world's staple crops are grown. The popular crops I analyzed include: apples, avocados, 
bananas, beans, cashews, cassava, cereals, cocoa, coffee, corn , grapes, oranges, potatoes, rice, soybeans, sugarcane, tomatoes, and wheat. I wanted to explore how 
different regions around the world contributed to the global food supply, and how much has changed in the span of sixty years, between 1961 and 2018. In other words, 
the main questions this report aims to answer are where are the world's major crops produced today, and how does it compare to global agricultural production from 
roughly sixty years ago. Visualizations of this analysis were created on Tableau.
